       "  'content': 'There are plenty of signs that AI is beginning to have a material effect on the world. One of the early signals may be the valuation of AI-related private companies such as OpenAI. Investors are willing to pay up for what they believe could be a potential leader in the field. The ChatGPT maker’s most recent funding round in the private markets valued the company at $300 billion. At current markets as of 3/3/25, this would place it as the 27th largest company in the S&P 500, a staggering valuation for a private entity. [...] There are risks abounding in the technology itself and the rapidly evolving investment landscape surrounding AI. Often with new technology, the initial spend is high as an arms race of sorts ensues. Also of note, the first companies and technology paths are often not the ultimate winners. A recent example is the emergence (or at least headline emergence) of DeepSeek, a Chinese-based AI platform which is thought to have been developed on the backs of several other AI technologies at a fraction of the cost. One might look back towards the “tech bubble” when simply having “.com” in the company name initially led to a rapid rise in the security valuation of that company, only to later dissolve in most cases. Capital was deployed inefficiently as the “land grab” took place.

AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.”',\n",
